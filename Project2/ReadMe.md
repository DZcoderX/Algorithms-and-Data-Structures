One way that software companies use to investigate usage of their applications is called telemetry.
In this project, I was given a set of data of users opening bookmarks and tabs. 
Given a set of data, I have to implement algoirthms to determine the popularity of each tab or bookmark among thousands of users. 
3 different data structures dictionaries were used: 
ArrayList<ValueFrequency> (ValueFrequency is a type of object that I created myself)
TreeMap<Integer,Integer>
HashMap<Integer,Integer>
