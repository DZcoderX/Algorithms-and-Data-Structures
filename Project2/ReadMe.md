One way that software companies use to investigate usage of their applications is called telemetry.

In this project, I was given a set of data of users opening bookmarks and tabs. 

Given a set of data, I have to implement algoirthms to determine the popularity of each tab or bookmark among thousands of users. 
3 different data structures dictionaries were used: <br> 
1. ArrayList<ValueFrequency> (ValueFrequency is a type of object that I created myself)
<br>
2. TreeMap<Integer,Integer>
<br>
3. HashMap<Integer,Integer>
